# Ked som jednotlive tabulky spojila, tak sa mi niektore udaje ovjavili viackrat, kedze tabulka religions_by_country obsahuje udaje pre jednotlive krajiny viackrat
# Neviem teda ci je to spravne, alebo sa to da spravit aj lepsie, ale mna nic nenapadlo :(
# Pri tabulke weather_conditions som sa zasekla pri convertovani teploty, ked to spustim vramci create table tak mi vypise chybu, takisto aj pri selecte:

# Dalej som sa nedostala, viem ze sme to mali vsetko nejako spojit do jednej tabulky, ale bohuzial sa mi to nepodatilo :(
